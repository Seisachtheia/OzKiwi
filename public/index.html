                    <p class="content">

                        Oz Kiwi pays our respects to Aboriginal Elders past and present and acknowledges the land on which we live and work is Aboriginal land – always was always, always will be.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        There has been a free movement of people between New Zealand and Australia pre-dating European settlement. The 1973 Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangements (TTTA) acknowledged the close relationship between the two countries, allowing all Australian and New Zealand citizens and permanent residents to move freely across the Tasman to visit, work, study, and reside.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Since 2001, the rights and protections of New Zealanders in Australia have slowly been eroded. Currently, any New Zealander arriving in Australia is granted an SCV (Special Category Visa). This visa allows the holder to reside indefinitely, but is classified as a “temporary” visa under the Migration Act and does not provide a pathway to citizenship.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Oz Kiwi is campaigning for the rights of New Zealand citizens, adversely affected by Australian immigration laws, who call Australia ‘home’.
